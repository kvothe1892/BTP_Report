Currently this is the plan that I have

Abstract
Introduction			--not sure how the sections should be
	(What is kmeans - colloquial, Where is it used)
	(Parallelization, Why parallelize?)
	(Our project basic intro. Papers read, Name and few lines on algorithms we used, Hardware features we used. Programming fundamentals involved)
	(-- Anything else you think would be relevant)

Chapter1 : K Means Clustering Problem
	*Definition, popular works
	*Approximation (why approximation. algorithms. bounds)
	*Sampling based approaches
		**KSS (with algo)
		**D2 sampling (with algo)
	*Analysis of sampling based approaches
		**Ackerman
	*Our analysis and Improvement
	*Theoretical results and conclusions

Chapter2 : Parallel Implemention
	*Need for parallelization
	*Basics of intel parallel architecture
	*Parallel programming imperatives

		--Can also make above 3 part of the same section

	*Parallel version of algo (and some comments)

	-- Some more sections involving the remaining code description and data
